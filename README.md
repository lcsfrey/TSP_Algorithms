# TSP_Algorithms
Traveling Salesman Approximation with GUI
This is a project I developed for my analysis of algorithms class. The objective was to research solutions to the traveling salesman problem and implement an approximation algorithm that could come up with efficient approximations in a fixed time frame.

# Features
  * Read test set from file
      * Reads lines of vertices from input file in the form "id x y"
  * Prim's Mimimum Spanning Tree
  * Nearest Neighbor Approximation
  * 2-Optimal Tour Approximation O(n^3)
  * GUI

# Todo List
  * Implement and display Dijsktra's Shortest Path Algorithm
  * Add ability to choose the starting point of Nearest Neighbor Algorithm and Dijkstra's Algorithm
